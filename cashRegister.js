// You have to create a program that will handle when the register does not have enough cash or will have no cash after the transaction. 
// Other than that it needs to return an array of the change in the form of an array, so that will be a 2D array.

// Hint: 1
// It is easier to handle if you have to close the register, or if you know how much money is in your register beforehand and you will not have enough money to complete the transaction. For this it is recommended to have a function to assign this information to a variable.
