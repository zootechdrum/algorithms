// Instructions

// A grerat problem for the multiple pointers strategy

// Implement a funciton called countUniqueValues, which accepts
// a sorted Array, and counts the unique values in the Array. There can 
// be negative numbers in the Array, but it will always be sorted. 

function countUniqueValues() {

//We want to have 2 pointers.
// One pointer will keep track of the current number in the array
// Second pointer will slowly move up and compare values agains our first pointer



//I needs to be initialized outside of loop
//Else it would keep being eqaul to 0.
let i = 0;
//This is the loop that will hold 2 pointers
for(var i , j = 0; j< arr.lenght; j++){


}

}

countUniqueValues([1,1,1,1,1,2]) // 2

countUniqueValues([]) // 0

countUniqueValues([-2,-1,-1,0,1]) // 2
